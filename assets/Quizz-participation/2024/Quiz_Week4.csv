Including it in a model can overshadow the rest, skewing the results and making the model focus more on Copenhagen than on the other municipalities. By leaving it out, the model might provide a clearer picture of the average municipality, better capturing the characteristics of smaller, less urbanized areas.

 

Copenhagen is a key part of Denmark, and leaving it out could mean missing an important piece of the country’s urban story. Just because it stands out from the rest doesn’t mean it should be ignored. Excluding it might cause the model to lose valuable insights, especially if the goal is to reflect all municipalities, including those with larger urban populations like Copenhagen. Every municipality has its own role, and that includes the big ones too.

 

The argument against filtering out Copenhagen is more compelling. While it might seem easier to remove such a large outlier, if the goal is to represent all Danish municipalities, Copenhagen should remain part of the analysis. Instead of excluding it, a better approach would be to use statistical methods that reduce the influence of outliers like Copenhagen, allowing the model to balance its impact while still capturing the full diversity of the population.

Copenhagen is much larger and more urban than other Danish municipalities. Its population, economic activity, and political dynamics are unique, which might skew the results if you're trying to model trends across more typical municipalities. By removing Copenhagen, you might create a model that is more representative of the majority of Danish municipalities and not overly influenced by the outlier.

 

Argument to do not remove:

Copenhagen is the capital and the most populous municipality in Denmark, representing a significant portion of the Danish population. Excluding it would reduce the generalizability of the model, especially if the goal is to capture national trends. Moreover, filtering out such an important municipality could lead to a model that doesn't reflect key national dynamics, given Copenhagen's economic and political weight.

Better argument:

In most cases, the argument against removing Copenhagen is stronger. Although it may be an outlier, Copenhagen is a critical part of Denmark's demographics. Excluding it from the model might lead to misleading conclusions, particularly if you're aiming for national-level insights. A better approach could be to handle its influence through other means, such as robust regression techniques or weighting, rather than outright exclusion.",0.0,"",0.0,"",0,"",0.0,5,0.0,.,0.0,"",0.0,"",0.0,"",0.0,"","","","","","","","","","","","",6,7,10.0

Removing it could make the model less representative of the entire country, its large population and influence in national politics make it essential to include, even if it is different from smaller municipalities. Excluding such an important data point may result in losing valuable information about the relationship between population size and political attitudes in larger cities. I would argue that Copenhagen should not be removed from the model, while it may be an outlier, its size and influence mean that it plays a crucial role in shaping political trends in Denmark.

Excluding Copenhagen may limit the generalizability of the model's findings. Since Copenhagen is a key part of the Danish landscape, understanding how its unique attributes affect the outcome can be critical.
