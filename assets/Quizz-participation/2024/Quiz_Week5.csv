An example could be the income of people with masters degrees in sociology and the income of people with masters degrees in social data science, where this could be problematic; when just comparing mean incomes would be ""fact"" that the sociology graduates would be on dagpenge, while the social data scientists would be ripping phat checks as quants for tech companies and hedge funds  :P . In this ""imaginary"" case comparing salaries would be pointless because too large of the selection wouldn't be employed at all. 

 

Confounding factors should also be taken into account. 

When we observe large data sets there's a great deal of variation between the individual groups of respondents. 

An example could be if we were comparing the means of two groups; like highly educated city dwellers in Copenhagen and retirees in Jutland, these two groups  might differ in many ways like age, health status and income. There is a lot of factors that could affect their preferences, so simply comparing the means would be down right lazy and we would end up with biased and misleading conclusions. 

A lack of randomization; RCT's would ensure that the treatment and control was balanced. This helps establish a fair comparison where differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment.

In smaller communities people might also be more susceptible to be presented with anti immigrant attitudes out of the fear of change. Being afraid that their small communities would change if the immigrant population would grow.

First, these comparisons can be influenced by confounding variables—factors related to both the treatment and the outcome—that, if uncontrolled, can lead to misleading results.

This method also assumes homogeneity in the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which oversimplifies complex interactions. Moreover, mean comparisons overlook the variability within groups, potentially obscuring significant treatment effects.

I think where people live is very complex, but there is an overall pattern due to for example age. And I assume more progressive people also would enjoy being in cities more and more conservative people in the suburbs or countryside, as to search out people with similar mindsets, so it becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.
