The variable ""postlet""contains the results of the letter-recognition test.
The variable ""encouraged"" indicates whether a kid was randomly encouraged by its pædagog to watch Sesame Street.
The variable ""prelet"" contains results from the same letter-recognition test, which the pædagogerne had conducted before they started to encourage kids to watch Sesame Street.

In a sense kids may try harder and this would impact our results regardless of their consumption of the piece of media in question. Even if significant the results could be considered biased if exclusion restriction is violated, leading to an invalid causal effect estimate.
