The bias adjustment applied to standard errors can be carried out in many ways, and you will experience that different statistical softwares do not calculate robust standard errors in the same way.

Higher population areas - in this argument I will infer that we are talking about urbanized areas, as in bigger cities- tend to have more diverse cultural norms and this diversity might reduce the influence of traditional gender performance. This could lead to less emphasis on gender when individuals are choosing their education. 

Keeping up with the original inference; urban are usually offering various different resources and exposure to ""non traditional"" career paths. In these areas individuals might be more informed of their opportunities - this could lead them to choose a path that they're passionate about, instead of a path that they might feel is expected of them. 

If smaller more rural communities are expected to have a stronger emphasis on social cohesion, more urbanized areas might have more influence on the expression of individuality, and in this sense remove some of the social pressure that gender reputation could have in the individual's' choice of education. 

Larger communities might also have more gender diverse role models. And maybe urbanized areas would prioritize subversive gender values; when it comes to the choice of profession, while rural areas might prioritize tradition. Again this is not a causal inference, only a correlational one :) ",0.0," 

Socioeconomic status could be a obvious factor that could confound with this relationship, if a individual comes from generational wealth one could assume that this gives them more freedom when it comes to career aspiration, regardless of cultural gender norms. And let's say their parents are wealthy, one could infer that they might have a high level of education themselves, having seen both genders being prevalent and sufficient in various fields, this could also give the children the feeling that ""the world was their oyster"" and that their gender shouldn't be a antagonistic factor in their choice of education. 

In urbanized areas there is usually also plenty of educational resources, different schools and academies. The plethora of choices, could lead individuals to forget about their genitalia, and or, their gender expression caused by the cognitive load that all these opportunities would've caused. 

Peer influence could also be greater; even if someone isn't from the upper-echelon of the socio-economic sphere, people in more urbanized areas are still packed together, and this could be a causal factor in them seeing that gender doesn't have to the common denominator in career choices. Diverse media exposure could, as well, be a factor. More exposure could mean more diverse expectations in general.  ",0.0,"The estimate for populationCount is now closer to zero (although still a negative number),No,Respondents living in an area with a higher population count\, report a smaller influence of gender reputation in education choice",3.0,"The standard error for the estimate of populationCount is now larger,No,No",13.333333333333332,4,0.0,"I got WAY wrong numbers in question 9 from my code, and i'm not sure why.
