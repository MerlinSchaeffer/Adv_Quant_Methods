In this quiz we will explore how a usual suspect sociodemographic variable, age, is related to political attitudes.
As our dependent variable / response variable, the quiz will use four different survey questions capturing political attitudes.
The names of the four response variables are:

Extra_FaithInPublicHospitalSystem
Extra_CompensateInflation
Extra_ImmigrationIsAThreat
Extra_UnemployedDontDoEnough

The labels are somewhat indicative of what the response variables capture. But it is always a good idea to use the codebook to understand the survey questions and scaling properly! I have been to one too many presentations, where the ""direction"" of the regression coefficient was misunderstood since the scaling of the regressor or response variable was misinterpreted.

This is because with a large enough N, and enough statistical power, even the smallest statistical relationships can be statistically significant.

First of all, there is a noticeably larger group of respondents that are somewhat satisfied with the public health system, closely followed by another large group that is completely satisfied with this service. Looking at age alone, there are 3 age groups concentring a larger proportion of respondents: 20 to 25 years old, 50 to 55 years old, and 65 to 75 years old. 

Now for the relationship between the variables; there is a relatively similar distribution of the age of participants across levels of satisfaction with the public health system. However, there is a slightly bigger concentration of older respondants satisfied with the public health system. This relationship explains the positive model prediction: a slight right skewed response seems to infer a positive correlation between age and faith in the public health system. 

However, with a largely scattered and balanced distribution of responses, the correlation is minimal, shown by the very horizontal model line. ",0.0,"","","","","","","","",118,0.0,"","","1.75,more",4.5,"","","","","","",11,1,66.5

First, the correlation between these two variables is 0.1161, indicating a weak positive relationship. This suggests that as individuals age, there is a slight increase in their faith in the public hospital system. However, this effect is minimal, as the strength of the correlation is far from substantial.

Further, looking at the regression analysis, the R-squared value of 0.0135 indicates that only 1.35% of the variance in faith in the public hospital system can be explained by age. In other words, age has a very limited impact on individuals' attitudes toward the public hospital system, and the overwhelming majority of variation in these attitudes remains unexplained by this single predictor. Moreover, the 

 coefficient for age is 0.0067911, implying that for each additional year of age, the level of faith in the public hospital system increases by just 0.00679 units. Considering that the intercept (constant) in the model is 3.5736, this change is negligible, as it indicates a very small shift in attitudes over time. Even with large sample sizes, such a tiny change would have little meaningful impact in a real-world setting. Finally, while the p-value < 0.01 confirms that the relationship between age and faith in the public hospital system is highly unlikely to be due to chance, statistical significance alone does not imply practical importance.",0.0,".0067911,.3989648,trust",6.666666666666666,"","","","","","",0.116,9.0,"","","0.096,more",4.5,"","","","","","",12,0,62.166666666666664
