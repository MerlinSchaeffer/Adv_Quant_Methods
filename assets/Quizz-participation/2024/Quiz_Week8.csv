The code generates two new columns in the dataset: femalePctandmalePct. These columns refer to the procentage of female and males on the educations that the respondents has indicated that they prefer to study.
For an example, if the respondent prefers to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse), the column femalePcthas the value 87.9 and the column malePct has the the value 12.1, which means 87.9% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are female, and 12.1% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are male.
The data should contain 1.728 rows and 36 columns.",0.0,"865899: So, it seems like if the respondents prefer a education that is generally preferred by females, it does not matter as much to them for their educational choices whether a education has a masculine or feminine reputation. Likewise, if respondents prefer a education that is generally preferred by males, it matters more whether a education has a masculine or feminine reputation.
In your opinion, why do we find such a relationship between gender distribution and influence of gender reputation?",10.0,865900: Should we interpret the correlation between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation as a causal effect? Why or why not?,10.0,"865903: In the last question, we moved from bivariate OLS regression to multivariate OLS regression by including a possible confounder to the relationship betweenfemalePct (procentage of females on the preferred education) andQ15_numeric(self-reported influence of gender reputation on educational choice). But we did not find the smoking gun; the relationship between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation persists.

For example, women who wear masculine clothing will generally cause less of a stir than men wearing feminine clothing.
It could also be that perceived female-dominated fields generally are considered as such because they are heavily female-dominated. In a lot of fields of work female workers/employees are perceived as an exception to a rule due to the history of women's inclusion in the work force. They are not as common in traditionally masculine work such as construction, plumbing, carpentry etc., or in high-profile white-collar work such as banking, CEOs of companies, politics and law. Most out-right ""feminine"" work would likely mostly mean service work (hairdressers, clothing, secretaries, assistive and administrative work) or ""empathy-work"" (nursing, teaching etc.). This could suggest a very conscious gendering of work fields. Therefore, coupled with my first argument, it could be that people who prefer ""masculine"" fields mostly consistent of men who are conscious of the gendering of their field and prefer it to not disturb their masculinity, and women who are also conscious of this gendering but chose the field anyway.

 ",0.0,"You could consider it correlated since it is statistically significant, but I think the analysis would benefit greatly from including the gender of the respondent. The distribution of gender in a field is likely correlated with the gendered reputation of the field in a sort of self-fulfilling relationship (more women => ""feminine field"" => more women => .., more men => ""masculine field"" => more men, etc.). But having the gender distribution of an education be the variable of interest itself might be a bit too abstracted from the respondents themselves.

I also am not sure about calling it ""causal"" since it is a very attitude-related correlation, which is probably says more about the way people think than an end-all-be-all influence on how they behave, and this way of thought is likely part of something larger and more structural or cultural than just gender distribution and reputation in education in of itself. But, the correlation is still there. But it seems to me that the gender distribution of the education is more so the outcome of other variables (such as respondents' gender) than it is the mechanism itself (altough there I'd assume there'd be some level of self-fulfilling-ness of gender-distribution in an education).

Also, in my assumption about gender performance, it matters a lot if the respondets who ""prefer a education that is generally preferred by females"" are women themselves or not. And likewise if those who prefer an education generally preferred by males are themselves men.

 ",0.0,"The estimate of femalePct is now closer to zero compared to the baseline model,No,Controlling for gender\, age and geography\, we cannot reject that the effect of femalePct on Q15_numeric is 0 (p>0.05)",20.0,"As detailed earlier, men and masculinity are under more scrutiny for the way they perform their masculinity than women and their femininity. Therefore, I would expect men who want to work in male-dominated fields to care more about the reputation of that field. 

Also, women are in the model less likely, at a significant level, to care about the gendered reputation of their field, whilst men are more likely to care. This correlation ""overrides"" the gender-distribution variable. If I go with my original assumption;

* Men choose education that is more traditionally masculine (and therefore also male-dominated) and therefore associated with masculinity, whereas fields associated with femininity are not as attractive to them because it could culturally harm their masculinity.

* Women care less about gender reputation, perhaps because their their femininity isn't challenged by feminine fields, and also not to the same extent by masculine fields. Perhaps a woman's concern would more be with gender-discrimination in heavily male-dominated fields, rather than the outside perception of the gendered nature of the work/education itself. But here there is perhaps a personal motivation to combat these bias and overcome these gendered masculine reputations, which in general have more positive implications than negative. Women will benefit more, both socially and also in pay, by overtaking ""masculine"" work, whereas men lose more by doing ""feminine"" work such as being a nurse rather than a doctor.
