Or rather - we need these packages for manipulating, cleaning, and wrangling the data - and then conduct our analysis. When working with quantitative data, most time is actually spent manipulating data - and therefore we need some packages to do so. On this course we will mainly work with the tidyverse, an opinionatedcollection of R packagesdesigned for data science.

These variables represent responses to a question asking which policy area the respondent considers most important for politicians to address. The data is binary, with a value of 1 indicating that the respondent considers the issue important, and a value of 0 indicating that they do not.

Specifically, with 29.22% of respondents rating healthcare as an important issue, it is a relatively significant concern. This could suggest that healthcare reforms, access, and quality are prominent topics, potentially due to recent developments like healthcare crises or reforms being debated. Further, environmental concerns are important to 13.20% of respondents, making it less of a priority compared to healthcare. However, this still reflects a significant minority focused on issues like climate change, pollution, and sustainability.
Moreover, at 4.71%, immigration is the least prioritized issue among the four. This might indicate either that the topic is not currently perceived as critical by the majority, or that other issues like healthcare and the economy are overshadowing it in the public discourse.
In addition, the  economy is an important issue for 15.27% of respondents. Economic concerns typically revolve around unemployment, inflation, wages, and fiscal policies, and their moderate importance here suggests they are central but not dominant.

With a closer look at the development of the political issue environment in October 2022 it can be inferred that it has been characterized by an initial period of fluctuation and modest concern, followed by a marked increase towards the end of the month. This trajectory indicates that while environmental issues were not consistently at the top of the public agenda, they gained significant traction as the month progressed, becoming an increasingly important issue for voters as the election campaign unfolded. 
More precisely, at the beginning of October, from the 5th to the 7th, public concern for environmental issues exhibited slight fluctuations. On October 5th, 12.46% of respondents indicated that they considered the environment an important issue. However, by October 7th, this percentage had declined to 10.29%. Moving into the second week of October, from the 8th to the 10th, there was a small but noticeable recovery in the importance placed on environmental issues, with percentages rising back to around 12-13%.  As the month progressed, the data from October 11th to the 13th shows another slight decline in the perceived importance of environmental issues, with percentages hovering around 11-12%.  From October 14th to the 18th, the data suggests a period of relative stability, with the percentage of respondents considering the environment important remaining fairly consistent between 10% and 14%. However, October 15th marks a slight peak at 14.20%, indicating a temporary increase in concern. A more significant shift in public concern for environmental issues becomes apparent towards the end of October. From October 19th to the 21st, the percentages begin to rise again, culminating in a noticeable peak of 12.97% on October 21st. This increase is part of a broader trend that continues through the end of the month. In fact, the most dramatic changes occur between October 22nd and October 31st. During this period, the percentage of respondents who considered the environment an important issue rose significantly, reaching 16.42% on October 28th, the highest percentage recorded during the entire month. This peak suggests that specific events or discussions during this period may have heightened public awareness and concern for environmental issues, making them a more prominent part of the political discourse. The data for the last few days of October indicates that this heightened concern for environmental issues remained relatively stable, with percentages staying around 14-16%, suggesting that by the end of October, environmental issues had solidified their importance in the political issue environment",0.0,11,1,71.0
