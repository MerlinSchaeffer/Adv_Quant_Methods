First, the t-value is 3.561, and the p-value is well below 0,05 (0.0003836), it means that there's a relationship between education level and economic security, and that the link is therefore statistically significant at a high level of confidence.

Also, the coefficient of the educational level is 0.09150, it means that each increase of one unit in the level of education, the perceived economic security increases on average by 0.0915 units. The effect is small, but not non-existent.

In summary, although education is statistically significant for predicting economic security, its impact is moderate and other factors are likely to play a more important role.
