First we are going to make two subsets of data:

Make one datasetcontaining only men (StudentGender==""Mand"")
Make one datasetcontaining only women (StudentGender==""Kvinde"")

The function ""filter()"" is probably a good choice here :)
Next we are going to make two regressions, both in which ""EducationRating"" is the dependent variable and ""WorkHours"" is the independent variable:

Make one regression using the subset of data containingonly men
Make one regression using the subset of data containingonly women

What is the regression coefficient of ""WorkHours"" formen? [m](first three decimals)
What is the regression coefficient of ""WorkHours"" for women? [w](first three decimals)
What is the difference between the two? [diff] (first three decimals)",9.0,"865672: Now, we know that the regression coefficient is different between men and women - but we don't know, if this is mery a result of happenstance or a statistically significant difference. For this we need to calculate an interaction model.
Please specify a regression model where ""EducationRating"" is the dependent variable. Include the variable ""WorkHours"" as independent variable and ""StudentGender"" as a control variable. Lastly, include an interaction term between ""WorkHours"" and ""StudentGender"".
First of all, investigate the coefficient of the interaction term. Does it resemble the difference between coefficients that you computed in the question before? [resem]
Following this comparison, how do you intepret the coefficient on the interaction term?[interpret]  
Unlike the difference we computed in question, we here get the standard errors for the interaction term and can thus inspect the statistical uncertainty pertaining to the interaction. Can we reject that the estimated interaction effect could in fact be 0 [sig] 
After the inclusion of an interaction term, the interpretation of the coefficients for ""WorkHours"" and ""StudentGender"" are no longer as straightforward as we are used to.
How should we now interpret the coefficient of ""WorkHours""? [wh]
Actually, the data is clustered in groups. This is because although we have 17.280 evaluated educations, we ""only"" have 1.728 people who evaluated. This means, that the classic OLS assumptions of independence between observations in the dataset is actually broken. Hence, we need to specify clusters = StudentID in the lm_robust-command to account for this data structure. Does doing this change the conclusions so far? [clust]",9.0,"865675: In this question we are going to add an interaction term between ""WorkHours"" and ""StudentAge"".
Please specify a regression model where ""EducationRating"" is the dependent variable. Include the variable ""WorkHours"" as independent variable and ""StudentAge"" as a control variable. Lastly, include an interaction term between ""WorkHours"" and ""StudentAge"".
What is different from the model before? [new]
How should we interpret the coefficient of the interaction term [int]?
Does the coefficient for WorkHours vary significantly across age? [sig]
How should we interpret the coefficient of WorkHours? [wh]",9.0,"865676: In the previous question the coeffiecients for ""WorkHours"" were perhaps not so informative, given that we rarely are interested in educational choises amongst newborns. To alleviate some of this nonsense, we can use ""mean centering"" to change the interpretation of those coefficients.
For this question you are going to mean-center ""StudentAge"" and ""WorkHours"". To do this, you can use the same method as Merlin used in his slides for week 11(it's on slide #14)
One you have mean-centered ""StudentAge"" and ""WorkHours"", run the same model as in question 5, but use the mean-centered versions of ""StudentAge"" and ""WorkHours"" instead.
What is now the interpretation of the coefficient on ""WorkHours""? [int] 
",20.0,"865677: Now, take the model from Question 3 with the interaction term between work hours and gender.
Now, visualize the results of this model with a plot.
Use the function ""plot_predictions"" from the marginaleffects package.
Set the arguments ""model"" to the name of you model-object and set condition = c(""WorkHours"", ""StudentGender""))
Please give an interpretation of the plot.

Just from looking at the model, it looks like women rate education with 25 work-hours at around 5.7, and a 50-hour work-week at around 4.8, and men rate a 25-hour work-week at around 5, and 4.15 for a 50-hour work-week.
