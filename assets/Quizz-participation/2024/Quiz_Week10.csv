On average, how much does logged wage change with every year of education? Remember, because we used log to the power of 2, the coefficient can be multiplied by 100 to be interpreted as a % change in wage given a one year increase in education.
Given a one year increase in years of education, wage [direction] by [change] percent.
",5.0,"865652: The data contain several variables. The outcome is logged wage and the predictor is education. Later we will use nearcollege4 and nearcollege2 as potential instruments.
In addition, the data also contain information about whether the respondents are Black, their age, the family status of their parents when they were 14, their parents' level of education, whether they currently live in the US South, and whether they are married.
Maybe, we can come closer to a causal effect of education on wages by controlling for these variables! But to do so, we need to decide, which ones of these variables we should consider as good pre-treatment controls and which ones might rather be problematic control variables (i.e. because they could themselves be the outcome of education).
