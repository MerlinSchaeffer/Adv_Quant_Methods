On average, how much does logged wage change with every year of education? Remember, because we used log to the power of 2, the coefficient can be multiplied by 100 to be interpreted as a % change in wage given a one year increase in education.
Given a one year increase in years of education, wage [direction] by [change] percent.
",1.0,"791366: The data contain several variables. The outcome is logged wage and the predictor is education. Later we will use nearcollege4 and nearcollege2 as potential instruments.
In addition, the data also contain information about whether the respondents are Black, their age, the family status of their parents when they were 14, their parents' level of education, whether they currently live in the US South, and whether they are married.
Maybe, we can come closer to a causal effect of education on wages by controlling for these variables! But to do so, we need to decide, which ones of these variables we should consider as good pre-treatment controls and which ones might rather be problematic control variables (i.e. because they could themselves be the outcome of education).

It's possible to think that if there is a college in the municipality, then the municipality is overall more affluent and has a higher amount of college educated people, which could overall increase wages. 

 

Furthermore, things like family or connections in another municipality, family SES and grades (for scholarships and accommodation) might decrease the usability of college in one's municipality as an instrument. ",0.0,"","","","","nearcollege4public,0.629",2.0,"","","","","","","significant,6%",2.0,"","",0.296,3.0,"","",0.186,0.0,13.26,1.0,9,1,16.0

In a higher populated area, there is also a higher demand for college education or generally higher education, which is the reason why more educational options can be found there.

But in bigger cities with more educational options, the cost of living is usually higher which results in therefore the wages are also generally higher. Another factor could be better chances of employement, since more companies would look for qualified personell in that area.

Not only is the distance of the college important, but also confunding factors like finacial possibilities. Even if there would be a near college, without financial stability or financial aid, college could still not be an option for people near a college.

This indicates that the instrument is good and that it is random.

 

Regarding the assumption of exclusion restriction (i.e., that the instrument of nearcollege4 only influences wages through its effect on the endogenous variable, education), I don't fully know whether this assumption is present.  However, my plausible theoretical considerations from question 3 regarding which control variables should be added and which should be omitted, indicate that I've controlled for the potential confounders that might correlate with the instrument and the outcome variable.
