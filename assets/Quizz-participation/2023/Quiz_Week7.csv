The variable ""postlet""contains the results of the letter-recognition test.
The variable ""encouraged"" indicates whether a kid was randomly encouraged by its pædagog to watch Sesame Street.
The variable ""prelet"" contains results from the same letter-recognition test, which the pædagogerne had conducted before they started to encourage kids to watch Sesame Street.
We are now interested in whether the randomization of the encouragement worked. Do you find any indication of imbalance across the treatment and control groups?",2.0,"790148: No matter what your kindergarden pædagog says, at the end of the day it is up to you whether or not you turn on the TV on saturday morning.
