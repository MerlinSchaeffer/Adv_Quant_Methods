The code generates two new columns in the dataset: femalePctandmalePct. These columns refer to the procentage of female and males on the educations that the respondents has indicated that they prefer to study.
For an example, if the respondent prefers to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse), the column femalePcthas the value 87.9 and the column malePct has the the value 12.1, which means 87.9% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are female, and 12.1% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are male.
The data should contain 1.728 rows and 36 columns.",0,"797836: So, it seems like if the respondents prefer a education that is generally preferred by females, it does not matter as much to them for their educational choices whether a education has a masculine or feminine reputation. Likewise, if respondents prefer a education that is generally preferred by males, it matters more whether a education has a masculine or feminine reputation.
In your opinion, why do we find such a relationship between gender distribution and influence of gender reputation?",1.0,797837: Should we interpret the correlation between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation as a causal effect? Why or why not?,1.0,"797841: In the last question, we moved from bivariate OLS regression to multivariate OLS regression by including a possible confounder to the relationship betweenfemalePct (procentage of females on the preferred education) andQ15_numeric(self-reported influence of gender reputation on educational choice). But we did not find the smoking gun; the relationship between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation persists.
Actually, we can include more than one possible confounder in our multiple OLS regression. Use the lm() function to estimate the impact offemalePct onQ15_numericwhile includingGender,AgeCategory, andRegion. Please answer the following questions.1) What has happened to the estimate offemalePctonQ15_numeric?

Basically, Q15 was meant to measure whether a education's gender reputation (is the education viewed as a masculine og feminine education) has an influence on respondent's choice of education. Simply put, Q15 was a statement that said ""It matters to me that a education has a masculine or feminine reputation, when I decide which education I want to study"". Answers were collected on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly agree"" and 1 means ""Strongly disagree"". We will use the column Q15_numeric for the analysis.

That may change how they perceive and prioritize gender-related factors. Certain academic disciplines and career paths are associated with specific gender expectations.

Also, representation in media within society might shape individual attitudes towards the gender composition of educational institutions. ",0.0,"Interpreting the correlation between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation as a causal effect can be ""dangerous"". Indeed, correlation does not imply causation, and establishing a causal relationship involves additional considerations.

On the one hand, if there is a strong theoretical basis supporting the idea that gender distribution influences the perception of gender reputation (or the opposite), it provides a rationale for considering a causal relationship. If the study design ensures that changes in the independent variable (gender distribution) precede changes in the dependent variable (influence of gender reputation), it aligns with the temporal order required for causation. If similar findings are consistently observed in multiple studies or diverse populations, it adds to the evidence supporting a causal relationship, and if the observed correlation aligns with known patterns and expectations, and the proposed causal pathway is plausible based on existing knowledge, it strengthens the case for causation.

On the other hand, the presence of unaccounted confounding variables introduces uncertainty, as these variables could be driving the observed correlation rather than a direct causal link. Without additional evidence, it's challenging to determine the direction of causality. It could be that the gender distribution influences perception, or vice versa, or a bidirectional relationship exists. The possibility of a third variable influencing both the gender distribution and the perception of gender reputation complicates the interpretation and weakens the case for a direct causal relationship. Individuals self-select into educational choices, and self-selection based on unobservable characteristics may introduce bias into the analysis, making it difficult to isolate the effect of gender distribution.

Svar: 

Dette kunne tyde på, at mænd generelt set er mere opmærksomme på hvilket miljø og status der skabes gennem ens uddannelsesvalg. Fordi at manden historisk set har været overlegen kvinden, bliver der nok stadig i en vis forstand set på mandedomineret uddannelser som ""bedre"" (også agtet den økonomiske forskel der er mellem f.eks. økonomi og sociologi-studerende). Respondenter der foretrækker maskuline jobs ved også at de kan tjene mere, og det ""maskuline"" omdømme bliver altså set som noget positivt.

Hvis man foretrækker kvinde-domineret fag, ved man godt at den lavere løn er et vilkår, og man vægter måske andre værdier højere (kvindedominerede fag er som bekendt inden for omsorgsfelterne). Der kunne altså være en større tendens til at vælge med ""hjertet"" her.
