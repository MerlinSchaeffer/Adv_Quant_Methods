The code generates a new column calledpopulationCount. This column measures the size of the population within the municipality where the respondent lives (reported in in 10 thousands).
For an example, if the respondent has a value of 9.6847 onpopulationCount, that means the respondent lives in a place that has a total population of 96847 people (9.6847 times 10000).

As you might remember,Q15 was meant to measure whether an education's gender reputation (whether a education is viewed as a masculine og feminine education) has an influence on respondent's choice of education. Simply put, Q15 was a statement that said ""It matters to me that a education has a masculine or feminine reputation, when I decide which education I want to study"". Answers were collected on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly agree"" and 1 means ""Strongly disagree"".

",1.0,"798219: All statistical inference rely on the fact that your sample is randomly selected from a defined population. In the real world, sampling respondents to a survey is quite hard and background characteristics often do not align with that of the population. Thus, pollsters use weights to make small post-corrections to the sample in order for the background characteristics to line up with them of the population. Simply put, it means that one respondent does not always equal one observation, but sometimes if a respondent has underrepresented characteristics, the respondent will count for slightly more than one observation - and vice versa. Lets see what difference it makes to use weights in this case!

",1.0,"798288: When working with heteroscedasticity corrections (robust standard errors), standard errors are not just standard errors. The bias adjustment applied to standard errors can be carried out in many ways, and you will experience that different statistical softwares do not calculate robust standard errors in the same way.
For an example, it can be a pain to replicate results from Stata in R if we do not pay attention to what kind of bias adjustment we apply to the standard errors. But the lm_robust() function from the {estimatr} package makes it easy for us. The creators have explicitly made an argument (se_type) that lets you choose which bias adjustment you want to apply. Conveniently, they have even made it possible to state se_type = ""stata"" which allows us to apply the same bias adjustment as Stata uses.

Additionally, regional policies and the availability of educational resources may differ, contributing to variations in gender-related influences on education.
