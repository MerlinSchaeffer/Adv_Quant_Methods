Nurse (""sygeplejerske"") is often used as a education that has a gender bias problem in their student composition. Lets use both the survey and Statistics Denmark's API to examine that!In the survey data, the variable ""RealEducationPreference"" indicates which education the respondent expect to apply for. Use the variable to examine how big a proportion of the total number of respondents in the survey, state that they would like to study ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse)?",1.0,"792096: Now, use the Statistics Denmark API to find out how many students that were enrolled as ""Sygepleje og sundhedspleje"" (=Nurse) as of 1st of October 2022.

Examine how information on gender distribution of students enrolled on the education (ExpGenderDistribution) impact the rating of the education (ExpEducationRating) by potential students.
