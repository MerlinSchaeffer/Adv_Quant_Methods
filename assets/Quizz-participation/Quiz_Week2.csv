In this quiz we will explore how a usual suspect sociodemographic variable, age, is related to political attitudes.
As our dependent variable / response variable, the quiz will use four different survey questions capturing political attitudes.
The names of the four response variables are:

Extra_FaithInPublicHospitalSystem
Extra_CompensateInflation
Extra_ImmigrationIsAThreat
Extra_UnemployedDontDoEnough

The labels are somewhat indicative of what the response variables capture. But it is always a good idea to use the codebook to understand the survey questions and scaling properly! I have been to one too many presentations, where the ""direction"" of the regression coefficient was misunderstood since the scaling of the regressor or response variable was misinterpreted.
Use the codebook to answer: What does a value of ""4"" mean on the Extra_CompensateInflation variable?",1.0,"758319: On a scale from 0 (the worst possible quiz for this course) to 10 (the best possible quiz for this course), how would you rate the quiz, that you have just completed?",0.0,"758320: If you have any suggestions as to how we can improve these quizzes, feel free to let us know here.

For example, by running a histogram on the age variable we see two respondents are much older than 100 years. This is highly unlikely, so we will filter out these respondents.

Not exactly. A good rule of thumb is that if you cannot visualize a result, it is not substantially important, even though it might be statistically significant. This is because with a large enough N, and enough statistical power, even the smallest statistical relationships can be statistically significant.

Yet, run them such that the strength of the coefficients is comparable. This means that we have to rescale the variables and make sure that the two models are run with the same observations, if one or both the regressor variables have missingness.

From the visual reprensentation of the relationship, it is shown that the distribution of people older than 40 are slightly more dense than ages below, the more they agree with the idea that they should be compensated (values 3-5). However, there is also a slight increase in ages below 40, in the value of 4 meaning that a substiantially amount of people younger than 40 also somewhat agree that they should be compensated. However, the linear regression shows that the relationship between age and the attitude variable, is negative; meaning that however small, the plot shows that the younger you are the more you believe you should be compensated. However, my verdict is that there is an overall equal distribution between all ages, and that they all somewhat agree.
