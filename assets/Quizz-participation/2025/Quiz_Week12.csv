Start by transforming the data: Group the data byage and then calculate the mean of Extra_ImmigrationIsAThreat with each year of age. Then, create a scatter plot with age on the horisontal axis and mean attitudes towards immigrants on the vertical axis. Please answer the following questions:
1) When do respondents exhibit the strongest anti-immigrant attitudes? Answer: [strong]2) At which age does the mean attitudes towards immigrants hit the lowest point? Answer: [low]",9.0,"941497: Now, apply a regression line to the scatter plot. You can do this be copying the following code. From the ""methods"" argument in the geom_smooth() function, we specify that it should be a linear model that follows what we input to the ""formula"" argument. Lastly, we paint the line red in the ""color"" argument to distinguish it from the dots in the plot.

After running the code, examine the plot. Does the red line follow the dots in the data?",9.0,"941498: The red line shows that the relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and age does not follow a linear trend. Therefore, we know that the estimate of age in our baseline OLS regression model is biased. Here, we can address the problem by using polynomial regression. Polynomial regression involves adding polynomial terms to our baseline OLS regression model. But how many polynomial terms should we add to the model?
This can be hard question to answer, but a nice place to start is to try out different degrees of polynomials in the visual representation. Run the code in the script that adds a blue line which includes a quadratic term (x2) in the ""formula"" argument of the geom_smooth() function.What has happened to the linear model by adding the quadratic term?",9.0,"941499: Lets try to add a cubic term (x3) and a quartic term (x4) as well. Follow the script and add the cubic term as a green line and the quartic term as a yellow line. You can do this by editing the ""formula"" argument of the geom_smooth() function to ""y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3)"" for cubic polynomial regression and ""y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) + I(x^4)"" for quartic polynomial regression.
Which one of the lines (red, blue, green or yellow) do you think fits the data best?",9.0,"941500: Now, it has become a bit hard to see the original data points because of all the lines. Therefore, create a scatter plot with only the line that you think fits data best. Save the plot with the ggsave() function and upload the picture here.",20.0,"941504: On a scale from0(the worst possible quiz for this lecture) to10(the best possible quiz for this lecture), how would you rate the quiz, that you have just completed?",0.0,"941505: If you have any suggestions as to how we can improve these quizzes, feel free to let us know here.
