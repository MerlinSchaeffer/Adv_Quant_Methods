Hence, if and why males and females tend to pick different educations in Denmark.
Nurse (""sygeplejerske"") is often used as a education that has a gender bias problem in their student composition. Lets use both the survey and Statistics Denmark's API to examine that!In the survey data, the variable ""RealEducationPreference"" indicates which education the respondent expect to apply for.
