",9.0,"941353: When working with heteroscedasticity corrections (robust standard errors), standard errors are not just standard errors. The bias adjustment applied to standard errors can be carried out in many ways, and you will experience that different statistical softwares do not calculate robust standard errors in the same way.
For an example, it can be a pain to replicate results from Stata in R if we do not pay attention to what kind of bias adjustment we apply to the standard errors. But the lm_robust() function from the {estimatr} package makes it easy for us. The creators have explicitly made an argument (se_type) that lets you choose which bias adjustment you want to apply. Conveniently, they have even made it possible to state se_type = ""stata"" which allows us to apply the same bias adjustment as Stata uses.
