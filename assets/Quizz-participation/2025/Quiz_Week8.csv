The code generates two new columns in the dataset: femalePctandmalePct. These columns refer to the procentage of female and males on the educations that the respondents has indicated that they prefer to study.
For an example, if the respondent prefers to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse), the column femalePcthas the value 87.9 and the column malePct has the the value 12.1, which means 87.9% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are female, and 12.1% of the respondents who prefer to study for ""Sygeplejerske"" (=Nurse) are male.

Likewise, if respondents prefer a education that is generally preferred by males, it matters more whether a education has a masculine or feminine reputation.
In your opinion, why do we find such a relationship between gender distribution and influence of gender reputation?",10.0,941470: Should we interpret the correlation between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation as a causal effect?

But we did not find the smoking gun; the relationship between gender distribution on the education of choice and the influence of gender reputation persists.

Men might be more aware when going into to female-dominated fields because it seems less socially acceptable than when women go into male-dominated fields, and that can be the reason for gender distribution being less important for women.
