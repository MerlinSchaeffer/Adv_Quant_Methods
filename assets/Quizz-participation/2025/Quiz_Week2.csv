In this quiz we will explore how a usual suspect sociodemographic variable, age, is related to political attitudes.
As our dependent variable / response variable, the quiz will use four different survey questions capturing political attitudes.
The names of the four response variables are:

Extra_FaithInPublicHospitalSystem
Extra_CompensateInflation
Extra_ImmigrationIsAThreat
Extra_UnemployedDontDoEnough

The labels are somewhat indicative of what the response variables capture. But it is always a good idea to use the codebook to understand the survey questions and scaling properly! I have been to one too many presentations, where the ""direction"" of the regression coefficient was misunderstood since the scaling of the regressor or response variable was misinterpreted.
