How many rows are in the popCount-data? [popCount]",1.0,"758016: Now we have a data frame of municipalities and population sizes.
Then, we need to prepare and summarize the survey data.
Read theelection campaign data, select the variable for municipality of residence, the variable for perceiving immigration as a threat and the variable for thinking Inger Støjberg should be allowed to be minister. Remove all missing observations across the three variables. How many rows are in this data? [nrow_survey]
Fill out the code in the quizzscript to summarize the survey data to municipality level data showing for each municipality the mean attitude towards immigration and the proportion who thinks Inger Støjberg should be allowed to be minister after the election. What proportion of citizens in Copenhagen thinks Inger Støjberg should be allowed to be minister after the election (3 digits)? [propCop]

Then use the script to make a boxplot of the relationsship between the population count and the municipality urbanization groups.
Based on the boxplot, think about which of the two is the better measure of urbanization and what potential effects that might be overlooked in the models we have calculated up until now

First, tidy the model output using tidy() with the conf.int -argument and filter as shown in the quiz script.
Then, modify the coefficient-plot code to create a coefficient plot.

I can however still try to formulate general arguments:

An obvious argument against, is that filtering out Copenhagen is very disruptive to the data, and seems to me to be a crude attempt to force the model to fit the data, rather then accepting that the data dose not support the proposed model. 

An argument for could perhaps be, that there is a great deal of differences between Copenhagen and many other municipalities in denmark, and insisting on keeping Copenhagen in, renders a otherwise good model useless.

 

Obviously i haven't yet been able to make the code work and produce the model that im trying to discuss here, so maybe im talking nonsense - i haven't been able to see for myself.  Anyway i think as a general rule, that you should refrain from filtering out data.

Excluding it could lead to a model that doesn't accurately reflect the diverse urban dynamics  in the country. Removing it could lead to a model that is less representative of the overall Danish municipal landscape.

The decision between keeping or removing Copenhagen must be taken considering the specific research question, and the need for generalizability versus specificity in the study. If the goal of the study is to understand general tendencies of the average danish municipalities, we can justify the exclusion of Copenhagen.

Copenhagen is the capital and it thus important to keep due to its large size and more diversity than the other municipalities. If it is filtered out could lead to a model that does not account for its true influence on the other Municipalities.

Copenhagen as a statistical outlier. Copenhagen is the capital city and therefore potentially/likely lays a higher economically than other municipalities. This might distort and/or pull the regression as seen by cooks distance. If we filter it out we get a better representation of the municipalities with a more equal likeness.

Agains:

As Copenhagen is the capital, and is therefore also a great representation for Denmark as the larger and most diverse municipality, it could skew decision being taken of this analysis not regarding the filtered out data.

Better argument:

Both has equal value in my opinion. I think this would very much depend of what use one would use the analysis for.",0.0,Oplandskommuner,0.0,"",0,"2,Yes",2.0,2,0.0,"please, this was hard.

The goal is to make a regression model that makes the best estimate of the effect the size of the municipality has on it perception on immigration.

Con - keeping the Copenhagen datapoint

Copenhagen has a much larger leverage than some of the other datapoints, which could be an issue since the perception on immigration in Copenhagen is only influenced by the size of the municipality, but also the share of immigrants or children of immigrants is larger in Copenhagen than i some of the smaller municipalities observed.
