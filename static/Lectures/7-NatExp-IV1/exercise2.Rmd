1. The variable `watched` indicates whether a kid watched Sesame Street. The variable `postlet` contains the results of the XYZ. Did kids who watched Sesame Street perform better on the XYZ? `r mcq(c("No, the result is not statistically significant", "No, the slope coefficient is actually negative", "Yes, the R2 is larger than 0.1", answer = "Yes, on average kids who whatched have ca. 13 points more and this is statistically significant", "Yes, we see three stars"))`. Is this evidence of an average causal effect? `r mcq(c("No, because there is no significant effect", "Yes, because the result is significantly positive", answer = "No, there could be selection bias into watching Sesame Street"))`

`r hide("R solution -> dont' peak to early ;) !")`
```{r}
ols <- lm_robust(postlet ~ watched, data = sesame)
screenreg(ols, include.ci = FALSE, digits = 3)
```
`r unhide()`

2. The variable `encouraged` indicates whether a kid was randomly encouraged by its teacher to watch Sesame Street. Did kids who were encouraged to watch Sesame Street perform better on the XYZ? `r mcq(c(answer = "No, the result is not statistically significant", "No, the slope coefficient is actually negative", "No, the R2 is smaller than 0.1", "Yes, on average kids who whatched have ca. 3 points more and this is statistically significant"))`. Is this evidence of an average causal effect? `r mcq(c("No, because not all kids who were encouraged actually watched", "No, correlation is not causation", answer = "Yes, but of being encouraged not of watching Sesame Street"))`. In IV language, this is the `r mcq(c(answer = "Reduced form", "First stage", "LATE estimate"))`.

`r hide("R solution -> dont' peak to early ;) !")`
```{r}
ols2 <- lm_robust(postlet ~ encouraged, data = sesame)
screenreg(ols2, include.ci = FALSE, digits = 3)
```
`r unhide()`

3. How many kids complied to the encouragement? `r fitb(3.17, width = "4")` kids did. How much higher was the proportion of kids who watched Sesame Street among the encouraged kids compared to the non-encouraged kids? It was `r fitb(0.362, width = "4")` (three digits).
`r hide("R solution -> dont' peak to early ;) !")`. In IV language, this is the `r mcq(c("Reduced form", answer = "First stage", "LATE estimate"))`.
```{r}
# Make a table of absolute frequencies
(sesam_tab <- sesame %>% 
   select('watched','encouraged') %>% 
   table())

# Compliers are the encouraged who watched + the non-encouraged who didn't watch:
138 + 40

ols3 <- lm_robust(watched ~ encouraged, data = sesame)
screenreg(ols3, include.ci = FALSE, digits = 3)
```
`r unhide()`

4. Based on the above information, what is the IV estimate of the local average causal effect among complying kids? It is: `r fitb(7.94, width = "4")` (two digits).
`r hide("R solution -> dont' peak to early ;) !")`
```{r}
# The IV estimate is:
2.876  / 0.362
```
`r unhide()`

5. Install the following package: `install.packages("ivreg", dependencies = TRUE)`. Your can read about it here: [ivreg homepage](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ivreg/vignettes/ivreg.html). Use the command `ivreg()` to estimate the IV Local Average Treatment Effect. Does watching Sesame Street make Kids better at XYZ? `r mcq(c(answer = "No, the LATE is not statistically significant", "Yes, the effect is positive"))`

`r hide("R solution -> dont' peak to early ;) !")`
```{r}
pacman::p_load(ivreg)
twosls <- ivreg(postlet ~ watched | encouraged, data = sesame)
screenreg(twosls)
```
`r unhide()`
