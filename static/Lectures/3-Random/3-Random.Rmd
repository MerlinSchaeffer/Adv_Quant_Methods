OK, great: Randomness prohibits systematic biases and thus enables us to draw representative samples. If randomization has partly failed, we use post-stratification weights to counterbalance.

# Today's general lessons
- Randomness prohibits systematic bias!
  + Random samples are therefore representative (unless the sample msize $n$ is very small).
- Where random sampling fails, we use post-stratification weights o counterbalance bias.
- Random sampling results in a loss of reliability, the so-called sampling error.
- These errors are normally or t-distributed, depending on the size of our sample.
- We can estimate the sampling error from our data: $\hat{\sigma}$, the standard error.
- Because we know the Normal and the t-distribution, we can estimate 95% Confidence intervals to express uncertainty and conduct hypotheses tests to see how likely our finding is simply the result of happenstance.
- Hypothesis tests test the $H_{0}$, which is usually the opposite of what you try to demonstrate. 
  + They ask: What is the probability (i.e. the $p$-value, see below) that I observe these data, although in reality $H_{0}$ is true?
- $t$-value: How many standard erros is your estimate (e.g. $\beta$) away from the $H_{0}$ (i.e. usually 0).
- $p$-value: What area under the sampling distribution lies outside of $H_{0}\pm t$. By convention, the $p$-value should be $<0.05$.
