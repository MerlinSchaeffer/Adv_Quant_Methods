# Today's general lessons

1. R allows you to easily download tons of interesting data.
2. You can combine (i.e., join/merge) data than contain (at least party) the same observations, if they have some variables in common that uniquely identify them. This allows for a lot of fascinating analyses and great term papers!
3. Always make a scatter plot of the variables you want to correlate.
4. Z-standardization helps interpretation and gives a common unit to different variables.
5. The correlation coefficient is an easy to understand statistic of a (undirected) association between two variables.
6. As a linear model, regression expresses on outcome variable as a linear function of a predictor. It thus estimates a directed relation. 
7. $\beta$ the slope, tells us how average levels of $\hat{y}$ chnage with a unit increase in $x$. 
8. OLS finds the linear model that best fits the data.
9. Regression should under normal circumstances not be interpreted in causal terms.
10. Categorical predictors are (typically) dummy coded and then tel us the average difference in the outcome between a category to the reference group.
11. We should make sure that the correlations and regressions we estimate actually capture aprrox. linear relationships and that they are not driven by outliers.
