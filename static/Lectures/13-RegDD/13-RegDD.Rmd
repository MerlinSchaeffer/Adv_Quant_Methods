# The intuition for RDD is different

## With regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) we try leverage artificial thresholds to imitate experimental group assignment

Society has all kinds of thresholds where people get different treatment above and below that cut point:

1. Elections
  - The person with the most votes in an election gets to be the Mayor
  - Every other candidate else does not
2. Pension age
  - People above a certain age are allowed to withdraw their pension
  - Everyone else has to pay a penalty to do the same thing
3. Borders
  - People on one side of Ã˜resundsbroen pay one tax rate
  - People on the other side pay another tax rate

# RDD Intuitions

## What if we compared people who fall right on either side of the threshold?

- But right at the threshold, maybe it's close to random?

# But we need a model

.push-left[
The simplest approach is to use linear regression, and add a binary variable (0/1) *D* to indicate whether an observation *i* is above or below the threshold on the running variable of interest, *a*. Note that in the equations on the right, *y* is our dependent variable (e.g. death rate), and $\alpha$ is the intercept.
]

.push-right[

A simple regression model:

$$\begin{equation}
y_{i} = \alpha + \rho D_{i} + \gamma a_{i} + e_{i}
\end{equation}$$

We might also consider adding polynomial terms to help the model if we are not convinced that the relationship is linear. For instance, we could add a squared term (a "second order" polynomial):

$$\begin{equation}
y_{i} = \alpha + \rho D_{i} + \gamma_{1} a_{i} + \gamma_{2} a_{i}^{2} + e_{i}
\end{equation}$$

We can even add a polynomial with a power of three, or more! For instance, a "third order" polynomial:

$$\begin{equation}
y_{i} = \alpha + \rho D_{i} + \gamma_{1} a_{i} + \gamma_{2} a_{i}^{2} + \gamma_{3} a_{i}^{3} + e_{i}
\end{equation}$$

# Reminder!

## We would really like to compare people just barely on either side of the threshold

But so far we are using all the data points, and using polynomials to home in on real effect with our estimates. This lets us keep all the data, which gives us more statistical power. But there is an alternative.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

# Options
# For balancing quality with statistical power

1. Parametric Regression Discontinuity: Model the entire dataset, taking into account potential non-linearities in the data

2. Nonparametric Regression Discontinuity: *Only* use data that is within a certain distance of the threshold

---
# Nonparametric RDD

## How do we balance the "bandwidth"

If we draw the green box too small (too close to the threshold), we will lose statistical power and won't be able to draw meaningful conclusions. If we draw the green box too big, we get more observations, but we lose the strength of the comparison. We call the width of the box the "bandwidth"

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/RDD_intuition3.png')
```
---
# Nonparametric RDD

That is, we want to estimate this:
$$\begin{equation}
y_{i} = \alpha + \rho D_{i} + \gamma a_{i} + e_{i}
\end{equation}$$

But we only want to estimate it in a sample where:
$$\begin{equation}
threshold - bandwidth \ge a_{i} \le threshold + bandwidth
\end{equation}$$

Sociologist Robert Merton argued that this happens because we don't have enough available space to reward *every* deserving person (in his case, it was scientists...think the Nobel prize). We have to make decisions between people who are more or less equal, and rewarding one person at the threshold but not the other creates an actual inequality where there didn't use to be any.
