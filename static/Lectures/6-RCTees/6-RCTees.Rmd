The red bi-directed arrow is officially not part of the DAG. But helps it helps us to understand that the correlation between Discrimination and Reading the news is not causal in nature. The reason for this non-causal relationship is the existence of a backdoor path. The backdoor path is opened by German citizenship, which influences whether people read the news but also how much discrimination they experience.

# Today's general lessons

1. **Experiment**: A study in which the researcher manipulates one or more variables (the "treatment") and then observes the effect of this manipulation on another variable (the "outcome").

2. **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**: A type of experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group receives the treatment, while the control group does not. This randomization ensures that the two groups are as similar as possible at the start of the experiment, except for the fact that the treatment group receives the treatment and the control group does not.

3. **Randomization**: The process of randomly assigning participants to either the treatment group or the control group in an RCT. Randomization is important because it helps to ensure that the two groups are as similar as possible at the start of the experiment, which minimizes the risk of selection bias.

4. **OLS regression**: A statistical technique that can be used to analyze the results of an RCT. OLS regression can be used to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome, while controlling for the effects of other variables that may be correlated with the treatment.
