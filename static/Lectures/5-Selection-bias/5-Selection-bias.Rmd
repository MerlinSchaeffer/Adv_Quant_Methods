# Potential outcomes
## The Neyman–Rubin framework of causality

> The Rubin causal model is based on the idea of potential outcomes. For example, a person would have a particular income at age 40 if they had attended college, whereas they would have a different income at age 40 if they had not attended college. To measure the causal effect of going to college for this person, we need to compare the outcome for the same individual in both alternative futures. Since it is impossible to see both potential outcomes at once, one of the potential outcomes is always missing. This dilemma is the "fundamental problem of causal inference"

1. Causal claims are counter factual claims. Therefore they imply a comparison.
2. Potential outcomes: A theoretical framework to think about the comparison implied in causal claims.
3. Personal causal effect: The unobservable comparison for an individual case $i$ to experience treatment $D_{i}=1$ as compared to not experience that treatment ($D_{i}=0$).
3. Average causal effect: The average of personal causal effects.
4. Direct comparisons (i.e. differences in group means) are often fruitless and naïv, because of selection/confounder bias.
5. Selection bias: The baseline of the outcome is unequal between treated and non-treated subjects, because certain type of people select into/out of the treatment.
6. Balance test: Attempt to test for selection bias, but can only be applied to variables that are observed in the data at hand.
7. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG): A graphical theoretical framework to think about causality. It consists of nodes and directed edges. It may not contain cycles.
8. Backdoor paths: All paths linking $X$ and $Y$ that start with an arrow into $X$. Backdoor paths result in confounder/selection bias.
9. Confounder bias: = selection bias.
