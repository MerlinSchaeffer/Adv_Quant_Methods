# I assume

- You know how to use R and RStudio.


--


- You know basic statistics:
  + Descriptive statistics: $\%$, $\bar{x}$, $\text{SD}(x)$.
  + Associations: Correlation $r_{y,x}$, OLS regression $y_{i} = \alpha + \beta x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}$.
  + Inference: Confidence intervals, $t$-values & $p$-values.

--


- *You want to do professional analyses and communicate your results with appealing visualizations.*
