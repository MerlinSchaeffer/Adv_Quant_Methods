For this course you will need to do an exam that is integrated with Mads Jæger's course on inequality an stratification. For the first portfolio, Mads will give you a topic and you will be asked to formulate a research question, and to propose a theoretical answer to it by elaborating on the theories and the literature you have learned in his class.  

The second portfolio will be in this course and it will be due on **20 November 23:55 via Peergrade on Absalon**. The portfolio should be five pages long. If you team up with other students, it will be an 1.5 extra pages per person (i.e. 6.5 pages for two students, 8 for three and so on). 

Overall you will have three tasks in this second portfolio:

1. *Comparison, hypothesis, and selection bias* (approx. 1 page): Discuss the empirical comparison implied in your research question, turn it into a hypothesis (and its counter $H_{0}$), and elaborate on why a simple empirical comparison might be naïv and not informative about a causal effect. That is, what types of selection bias are likely to make a naïv comparison unfruitful? That is, for this task you need to understand and apply the lessons from [**Lecture 5**](/Lectures/5-Selection-bias/5-Selection-bias.html).
2. *Ideal causal research design* (approx. 2 pages): Propose how your research question could be tested using either an RCT or an IV design. That is, propose a RCT or IV research design: who and how many will be sampled for the study, what will be the experimental conditions be and why do they operationalize the research question well, how will respondents be allocated to the experimental conditions, how will the outcome be measured, how will you deal with non-complyers? Also discuss the advantages and limitations of your RCT/IV as well as its crucial assumptions. Importantly, the research design should be ethical (we cannot propose to take babies from their families and randomize them etc.), and feasible (we cannot propose to build new cities where segregation is absent and make people move there). That is, for this task you need to understand and apply the lessons from [**Lecture 6**](/Lectures/6-RCT/6-RCT.html) and [**Lecture 7**](/Lectures/7-NatExp-IV1/7-NatExp-IV1.html).
3. *Multiple OLS research design* (2 pages): Given that you will not be able to implement your own study, propose how you could test your research question using multiple regression as second best option. How would the OLS model look like, which parameter would test your hypothesis, and how would you judge it's effect size and significance? Importantly, which control variables will you include in your model, which ones not, and why? That is, for this task you need to understand and apply the lessons from Lecture 8 and Lecture 9 (coming up).

- Note that for the portfolio, you will not need to discuss the specifics of how OLS estimation works, or all of the statistical specifics of OLS, hypothesis test, or IV. What I want to see is that you have understood these techniques such that you can apply to test a theory and answer a research question in the best way possible.
