## 1. Problem Formulation and Structure of the Assignment**

In this home assignment (final exam) you must formulate your own research question and answer it based on data from [*to be announced*]. Your research question must meet the following requirements: [*to be announced*].

**Examples of research questions:**

1. [*to be announced*]
2. [*to be announced*]


**The exam assignment has three parts.**

In the first part, you must establish a brief theoretical framework. The purpose of this framework is to motivate [*to be announced*]. Use any literature from your prior studies for this theoretical framework (see petitum, see below). You should use the analytical framework to motivate the choice of explanatory variables (e.g., education and attitudes) and whether these variables are confounding or mediating variables in your analysis. For example, [*to be announced*].

In the second part, you must present a research design that you will use to empirically analyze and test your theoretical framework. This design has two sub-elements. (i) First, you must present the research design, which must be based on the statistical tools you have learned in this course. Describe the statistical tools you use (e.g., IV, OLS regression, RDD), and introduce the dataset and your operationalization of dependent and independent variables. (ii) Second, you must discuss what causal assumptions are baked into your research design and whether these assumptions are credible in your specific analysis. You should also (briefly) present an ideal research design that would allow you to identify the causal effects you assume in your theoretical framework. How could you use, for example, an RCT, IV, or RDD design to identify credible causal relationships?

In the third part, you must implement your research design, present and correctly interpret the result it produces. Make sure not to overstate causal claims in your interpretation and acknowledge limitations where necessary. You should draw on your theoretical framework and your research design when interpreting the empirical results, including whether the explanatory variables are confounders or mediators.

## 2. Data and Variables

[*to be announced*]

**2.1 Dependent Variable**

[*to be announced*]

[*to be announced*]

**2.3 Independent Variables**

[*to be announced*]

**2.4 Weights**

Remember to use the post-stratification weights in all your analyses if you analyze survey data.

**2.5 Requirements for the empirical analysis:**

- You must estimate a series of OLS/IV/RDD regression models.
- The purpose of the analysis is not to use as many independent variables as possible. The purpose is to include a (set of) well-founded independent variable(s) and to make a credible interpretation of the effect(s) of this/these variable(s).
- You must test for at least one non-linear effect or one interaction effect and must plot these using model predictions. You must give correct interpretation of the polynomial/interaction coefficients.
- You should consider any limitations in your empirical design in relation to being able to make causal interpretations. Could there be circumstances that challenge a causal interpretation?

## 3. Merit Students

[*to be announced*]

## 4. Practical Information

- The exam assignment follows the guidelines for a written assignment (see chapter 5 in the study regulations for sociology)
- The scope of the assignment is max 15 pages of 2400 characters if it is done by one student. 5 pages are added per student if the assignment is done in groups. A reasonable (but in no way binding) allocation of a 15-page assignment could be the following: introduction (2 pages), analytical framework (4 pages), methodology/data/variables (4 pages), empirical analysis (4 pages) and conclusion (1 page).
- You must not write your name in the assignment – all exam papers are anonymous.
- You must remember to enclose a declaration on the use of AI.
- Familiarize yourself with the rules regarding the use of syllabus and petitum (the latter are texts that you choose yourself and which are in addition to the syllabus). Note that (a) you must use and cite at least 25% of the syllabus in your assignment, (b) syllabus references may constitute a maximum of 2/3 of the total references and (c) petitum must constitute at least 1/3 of the total references.
- The deadline for submission is 12 January 2026 at 12 am (noon).

## 5. Practical Guide

**Introduction**

The purpose of this section is to give you some tips on how to organize your exam assignment. Some tips are about writing style and argumentation, while others are about how to best present your method and empirical results. The main ambition of this section is to give you tools so you can use as much space as possible on the core elements of your assignment: (1) theoretical framework, (2) research design (including methods and operationalization), and (4) analysis (including interpretation and visualization).

Note that this section is general and does not refer to the specific exam assignment. Therefore, all references to data, variables, etc. are intended as examples.

**What is the assignment – and what is it not?**

**Theoretical framework**

You come from the first year and have written assignments/exercises in theory courses. This is not a theory course. But empirical analyses always require theoretical motivation. Consequently, the purpose of your theoretical framework section is to draw on theoretical arguments to motivate and propose an explanation to the research question that you tackle. Write clearly and focused: the theory is the means and not the goal. Avoid implicit theoretical jargon ("structuring structures that structure...") and, as far as possible, present theoretical ideas in your own words (i.e., avoid many/long quotes from original/secondary sources).

Argue for your choice of theory/perspective. Tell us precisely why the theory(ies)/perspective(s) you have chosen to draw on are well-suited to illuminate the specific problem. The more concrete you are, the better your presentation will be. "I think theorist x is suitable" is not a good argument.

**Hypotheses:**

Aim at deriving directional hypotheses that you can test empirically. A directional hypothesis postulates a negative or positive effect of a variable on your outcome. For example, the following hypothesis is not directional: "There is a relationship between social class and whether you like popcorn". A directional hypothesis could be: "People from the working class eat more popcorn than people from the middle class".

You should use DAGs to illustrate your hypotheses and assumptions to identify their causal effects.

**Operationalization**

Operationalization: Describe how you interpret/understand and, if relevant, recode your variables, as well as what theoretical and practical circumstances motivate your choices. The reader should be able to follow your decisions from "raw data" to fully coded "analysis data". If you (re)code complex variables, e.g., social classes based on e.g., job titles or ISCO codes, you must describe all "intermediate calculations" (e.g., how you handle the self-employed, middle managers, and possibly people outside the labor market). And remember to give your variables easy-to-understand names (i.e., not something like "kl_z005").

**Discussion of Results**

The analysis of the empirical results should, as a starting point, always be unfolded in the section where you present the results. You should not divide the analysis into a descriptive part ("Table 1 shows number x and number y") and an interpretive part ("I interpret the results in section z below"). Keep the analysis together in one section.

**Tables and Figures**

You can advantageously collect important information in your tables so that you do not have to use more tables or more space than is absolutely necessary in the text to report intermediate calculations and test statistics (upside = more space for analysis and interpretation). Examples are the regression tables that we discussed every week in lectures. Remember to not put too much focus on "goodness of fit" statistics like R2; the primary way in which you test your hypotheses is by interpreting regression coefficients (and their standard errors).

Instead of a regression table, you can also present your results as a coefficient plot (see Week 6). If you decide to use a coefficient plot, be sure to include information about N (the number of observations) and the R2 value for the entire table (three decimal places) in a note to the plot.

You should also include two tables with descriptive statistics to the appendix. Such a table should show means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. As a starting point, you do not need to have more than one decimal place on numbers. That is, write 9.4 and not 9.4327654. In regression tables, however, you should have three decimal places! You can create word tables with descriptive statistics based on the datasummary_skim() function (see https://modelsummary.com/vignettes/datasummary.html). The resulting word documents can be opened and edited (you might want to change them a bit to make them nicer to look at).

**Writing/Formatting**

- Give all your variables and variable categories easy-to-understand and logical names. Do not refer to variables and variable categories with abbreviations or implicit R codes. For example, "gthorpe_5" does not make much sense to a reader, but "Goldthorpe's class scheme with five classes" does.

- Do not copy-paste tables/data from R. It rarely becomes neat or easy to read (and there are often [too] many decimal places included).

- All tables/figures must have an easy-to-understand title and must be numbered.

- Avoid footnotes. Everything important must be included in the main text.

- Meta text is important. Meta text means text that summarizes results and links sections together. For example, "In section 1, I showed that people in higher class positions are less likely to eat popcorn than people in lower class positions. In the next section, I will use the abnormally high price of corn oil to explain why this is the case."

- Avoid normative language ("my research shows that capitalism is evil and alienating"). You can be normative in your free time, not in your professional work as a sociological essay writer. You should also not be normative when putting your results into perspective (unless you are explicitly asked to do so).

**Conclusion/Discussion**

Make sure that you answer the problem statement unambiguously and comprehensively. Do this before you embark on a general discussion/perspective. The purpose of your assignment is first and foremost to answer the research question.

**Grammar and Language**

- Get a reading group partner and maybe use gen AI to check your assignment for spelling and typing errors. You don't spot the errors until right after you have submitted your assignment (this applies to all of us).

- And finally: No one expects perfection. The purpose of an exam assignment is to learn something new and something important. It also doesn't hurt if the writing process is fun. 

# Good luck 😊
