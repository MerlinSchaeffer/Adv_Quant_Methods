To successfully complete this course, you will need to fulfill two requirements:

1. **Completion of at least 10 Weekly Absalon online quizzes**: You must submit a minimum of 10 of the Weekly Online Quizzes available on the Absalon page for this course. Only by submitting at least 10 quizzes will you qualify for the second task. Quizzes should be submitted within two weeks after they are made available online. Completion of at least 10 weekly Absalon online quizzes is a prerequisite for being eligible to take the written take-home exam, which is integrated with the "Velfærd, ulighed og mobilitet" course.

2. **Integrated written take-home exam with "Velfærd, ulighed og mobilitet"**: The final assessment will be a written take-home assignment based on a set of questions to be answered individually or in groups of up to four students. The written take-home essay should not exceed a maximum of 10 pages. For group assignments, an additional 5 pages are allowed per additional student.

The final exam will be graded based on the following three dimensions, from the perspective of this course:

1. Comparison, hypothesis, and selection bias (approximately 1 page): Discuss the empirical comparison implied in your research question, develop a hypothesis (including the counter $H_{0}$), and elaborate on why a simple empirical comparison may be naïve and not informative regarding a causal effect. Address the potential selection biases that could render a naïve comparison unfruitful. This task requires understanding and application of the concepts discussed in [**Lecture 5**](/Lectures/5-Selection-bias/5-Selection-bias.html).

2. Ideal causal research design (approximately 1-2 pages): Propose how your research question could be tested using either a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) or an Instrumental Variable (IV) design. Outline the specifics of the proposed RCT or IV research design, including sample size and selection, experimental conditions, allocation of respondents, measurement of outcomes, and handling of non-compliers. Discuss the advantages, limitations, and crucial assumptions of your chosen RCT or IV design. Importantly, the research design should be ethical and feasible, taking into account practical constraints. This task requires understanding and application of the concepts discussed in [**Lecture 6**](/Lectures/6-RCT/6-RCT.html) and [**Lecture 7**](/Lectures/7-NatExp-IV1/7-NatExp-IV1.html).

3. Multiple OLS research design (approximately 1-2 pages): Given that you will not be able to conduct your own study, propose how you could test your research question using multiple regression as a second-best option. Describe how the OLS model would be structured, which parameter would test your hypothesis, and how you would assess its effect size and significance. Discuss the inclusion and exclusion of control variables in your model and provide reasoning for your choices. This task requires understanding and application of the concepts discussed in [Lecture 8](/Lectures/8-Multiple-OLS/8-Multiple-OLS.html) and [Lecture 9](/Lectures/9-Mult-OLS-in-practice1/9-Mult-OLS-in-practice.html).

Additionally, your writing style, coherent argumentation, referencing relevant literature, and other aspects of effective academic writing will be taken into account during the grading process.
