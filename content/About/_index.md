The course introduces you to advanced regression analysis and its application in sociological research with a special focus on causal analysis.

# Before the first session

Before the first session, I would like you to please [download R](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/), [download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), and install both on your laptop ([see also](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/installingr.html#installing-base-r)). Please always make sure to bring your laptop to class.

# Course structure

We meet once a week, every Wednesday at 10am. Every session lasts three hours and consists of lectures, two 15 minutes breaks, and some exercises. In addition you have a tutoring session every week where you can work in a smaller setting, ask questions, and properly work with R on stats problems.
