This course introduces you to advanced regression analysis and its application in sociological research with a special focus on causal analysis. It builds up on the general knowledge and familiarity gained with working with data in R 
in Basic Statistics. This course will enable you to become competent readers of contemporary, state-of-the-art 
quantitative sociological work and skilled producers of sophisticated regression analyses and its visualization for professional and lay audiences.

The course progression starts with a recapitulation of ordinary least squares regression as the workhorse of 
contemporary quantitative sociology as well as the fundamentals of statistical inference. From there it advances your knowledge of OLS regression and introduces applications of OLs regression that allow you to estimate causal effects.

# Before the first session

Before the first session, I would like you to please:

- [Get a recent version of R (>= 4.0.0)](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/).

- [Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
  + [See also](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/installingr.html#installing-base-r)). 
  
- Please always make sure to bring your laptop to class.

# Course Components and Expectations 

This course is comprised of methodological and substantive lectures introducing important 
concepts, statistical methods, and their broader relevance, on the one hand, and exercise classes in 
which students will gain first-hand experience in using and discussing them, on the other. For successful participation in this course there are three expectations: 

1. Thoroughly prepare for each class with the assigned readings. 
2. Actively follow lectures asking questions were relevant and engage in discussion and posed tasks in exercise classes. 
3. Solve the exercises posed both in class and in preparation of the exercise sessions.
3. Prepare and submit a portfolio exam, which is an integrated exam with Mads' Jæger's course.

# Course structure

We meet once a week, every Wednesday at 10am. Every session lasts three hours and consists of two iterations of lecture, 15 minutes break, and small exercise. In addition, you have a tutoring session every week where you can work in a smaller setting, ask questions, and properly work with R on stats problems.

# Course Literature 
In this course we use two text books. To recap on OLs regression and statistical inference, we continue to use the textbook from last semester:
- Veaux, De, Velleman, and Bock. 2021. Stats: Data and Models, Global Edition. Pearson Higher Ed.

In addition, we will make heavy use of another book to understand, how regression analysis can be used to identify causal effects:
- Angrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2014. Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect. Princeton University Press.

Both books are available from Academic Books on the City Campus as well as on the term 
shelves at the university library.
