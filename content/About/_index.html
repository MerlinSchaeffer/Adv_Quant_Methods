<p>This course introduces you to advanced regression analysis and its application in sociological research with a special focus on causal analysis. It builds on your Intro to R course a yar ago and your Basic Statistics course last semester.</p>
<p>The course progression starts with a recapitulation of ordinary least squares regression as the workhorse of
contemporary quantitative sociology. From there it advances your knowledge of OLS regression and introduces applications of OLS that allow you to investigate complex relationships and causal effects.</p>

<h1>Before the first session!</h1>
<p>Before the first session, I would like you to please follow these steps in exactly this order, regardless of whether you have worked with R and RStudio before.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/">Get a recent version of R (&gt;= 4.2.0)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">Install RStudio</a>. Check also <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/installingr.html#installing-base-r">this homepage</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open RStudio and follow these <a href="Lectures/0-Prep/0-Prep.html">instructions to setup a Project</a> for this class.</p></li>
<li><p>As a third step, run the lines of code below in the Console of your RStudio. Note that this can take a while. If you are asked whether you want to “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?” answer: “no”. Make sure to wait until the courser blinks behind a <code>&gt;</code> again. Press enter again two times to produce two more <code>&gt;</code>.</p></li>

<li>Now type <code>sessionInfo()</code> into your console and check whether all of the following are mentioned under “other attached packages”: tidyverse, ggplot2, wbstats, texreg, estimatr, modelr, furniture, modelsummary, ivreg, countrycode, remotes, rosdata, masteringmetrics, and finally democracyData. <strong>If any package is missing.

<h1>Course Components and Expectations</h1>
<p>This course is comprised of methodological and substantive lectures introducing important
concepts, statistical methods, and their broader relevance, on the one hand, and exercise classes in
which students will gain first-hand experience in using and discussing them, on the other. For successful participation in this course there are three expectations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Thoroughly prepare for each class with the assigned readings.</li>
<li>Actively follow lectures asking questions were relevant and engage in discussion and posed tasks in exercise classes.</li>
<li>Solve the exercises in class, and the weekly Online Quizzes on Absalon.</li>
<li>Prepare and submit a portfolio exam, which is an integrated exam with Mads’ Jæger’s course.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level1">
<h1>Course structure</h1>
<p>We meet once a week, every Wednesday at 10am. Every session lasts three hours and consists of two iterations of lecture, 15 minutes break, and small exercise. In addition, you have a tutoring session every week where you can work in a smaller setting, ask questions, and properly work with R on stats problems.</p>

<div id="course-literature" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Literature</h1>
<p>In this course we use two text books. To recap on OLs regression and statistical inference, we continue to use the textbook from last semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Veaux, De, Velleman, and Bock. 2021. Stats: Data and Models, Global Edition. Pearson Higher Ed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we will make heavy use of another book to understand, how regression analysis can be used to identify causal effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2014. Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect. Princeton University Press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both books are available from Academic Books on the City Campus as well as on the term
shelves at the university library.</p>
