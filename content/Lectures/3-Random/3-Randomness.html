<p>We often perceive science as precise, deterministic, and systematic. However, when it comes to modern statistics, we require the opposite: randomness! Randomness plays a vital role in ensuring the generalizability of our results, making them representative, and facilitating the estimation of causal effects. In this discussion, we will delve into the significance of randomness in statistics. Following that, we will provide a recap of statistical inference, which elucidates how randomness enables us to extrapolate from our specific dataset to the broader world.</p>
