To be fair, most of the time we use multiple OLS without a randomized treatment. We use OLS to analyze all kinds of observational data and to improve the comparisons we make. But now that we have a solid background in thinking about causal effects and the importance of randomized treatments, we can discuss and think more clearly about how to use multiple OLS to improve the comparisons we can make based on observational data. At the end, we will even discuss some cases, in which multiple OLS allows us to estimate causal effects.
