<p>Multiple OLS is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze all sorts of data to make comparisons and thereby learn about causal effects. But to be fair, most of the time we use multiple OLS without a randomized treatment. Instead, we use OLS to analyze all kinds of observational data. Observational data is data that is collected without the researcher randomly assigning participants to different treatment groups. This means that there is a risk of bias in the data, as the treatment and control groups may not be comparable.</p>
<p>Despite the risk of bias, multiple OLS can be used to improve the comparisons that we make in observational data. This is because multiple OLS can control for confounding variables. In some cases, multiple OLS can be used to estimate causal effects. This is possible if the confounding variables can be fully controlled for. This means however, that we need to identify all relevant confounders as good as possible.</p>
<p>In this lecture we will learn to use our solid background in thinking about causal effects and the importance of randomized treatments, to <em>theorize</em> about which confounders might bias a comparison and how we use multiple OLS regression to improve the comparison. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the method. Multiple OLS should not be used to make causal inferences without carefully considering the potential for bias.</p>
