So far we have had a helpful but quite old-school perspective on IV: We way up the causal effect of a random instrument by the people who actually complied with the treatment intended by the instrument. But now that we have a thorough understanding of the Frisch-Waugh Theorem, we can take another perspective on IV-Regression: Two-Stage Least Squares. That is, we can identify the random variation in our treatment $D$ that the instrument $Z$ has induced in to it. Today you learn how.
