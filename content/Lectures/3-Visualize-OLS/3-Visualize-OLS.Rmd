<!-- In this first lecture will will do a recap of correlation and regression analysis. Linear OLS regression is the backbone of statistical modeling and social data science. Most complex models, including the causal analysis that we focus on later this semester, are extensions of linear OLS, and thus you should know your OLS well. In this session you will get a brief recap of multiple OLS with continuous and categorical predictors, how to conduct it in R, and how to communicate the results of your linear OLS models in regression tables. On the route to that, you will also learn to download from within R fascinating data from the Worldbank and other sources on poverty, inequality and other topics from around the world. -->
