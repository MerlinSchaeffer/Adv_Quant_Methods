In this advanced statistics course, you'll gain a key skill: estimating causal effects. This is the next step after the complex mathematical concepts from last semester and will help you answer meaningful questions about the world.

We'll investigate fascinating topics, such as the effect of anomie on suicide rates and the relationship between policing and domestic violence.

This course will connect the dots between your previous classes. We will combine your knowledge from research design and basic statistics, add new analytical tools, and explore the methods researchers use to address questions that resonate with all of us.
