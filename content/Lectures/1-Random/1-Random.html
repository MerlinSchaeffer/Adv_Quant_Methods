<p>In this first lecture you will learn why <em>randomness</em> is so important in quantitative social science research. Specifically, we rely on randomization for two very important goals. First, we use randomization to get unbiased (i.e., representative) samples of the populations that wish to study. Second, we use randomization to estimate causal effects. Intriguingly, the logic behind both goals is the same: If samples are large enough, randomization ensures that there is no imbalance (i.e., systematic difference) between sample and population, or between treated and control group.</p>
