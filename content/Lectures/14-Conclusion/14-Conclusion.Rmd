As this quote illustrates, the divide between qualitative and quantitative research is often artificial. Ultimately, all research aims to draw valid conclusions from data. And we largely face the same challenges and biases in doing so. Furthermore, the traditional distinction between qualitative research focusing on interpretation/hermeneutics and quantitative research focusing on causal explanation is becoming increasingly blurred, especially with the rise of AI. After all, AI excels at hermeneutics â€“ the interpretation of text, images, videos, and sound.

In this final session, I will provide a general overview of the course content. Afterwards, you will have the opportunity to ask questions or raise any topics you wish.
