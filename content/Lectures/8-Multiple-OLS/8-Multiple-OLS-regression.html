<p>What happens if our balance test tells us that randomization has failed? Is everything lost? Fortunately not! OLS allows us to control for imbalanced confounders. In this session, we will learn how OLS does that and how the Frisch-Waugh Theorem gives us an intuitive understanding of the underlying statistics. That said, we can only control for confounders that we have observed in the data. OLS will therefore never be a perfect fix.</p>
