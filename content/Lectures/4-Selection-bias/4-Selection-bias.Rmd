The statistician and eugenicist [Ronald Aylmer Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) came up with the idea of Randomized Controlled Trials to estimate causal effects. His and other early statistician's support for eugenics gives statistics a bad reputation. However his ideas of RCTs saves lives all around the planet. RCTs are the last threshold any new pharmaceutical product needs to pass. In the social sciences we have also started to use RCTs more and more over the past decades. The basic idea is to run an experiment with a treatment and control group and to decide who gets treatment or control randomly, hence the name randomized controlled trial. Today we will understand why this method is the gold standard to tackle the biggest challenge we have when we wish to estimate causal effects: selection bias.
