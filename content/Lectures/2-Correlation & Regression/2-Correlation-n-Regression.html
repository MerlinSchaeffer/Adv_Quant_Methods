<p>In this first lecture, we will provide a recap of correlation and regression analysis. Linear OLS regression is fundamental in statistical modeling and social data science. Many advanced statistical techniques build upon linear OLS. Therefore, it is crucial to have a strong understanding of it. During this session, we will have a brief review of bivariate OLS with continuous variables and how to perform it in R. Along the way, you will also learn how to download captivating data from the World Bank and other sources directly within R. This data will encompass various topics, including poverty, inequality, and more, from around the world.</p>
