<p>We tend to think of science as precise, deterministic and systematic. But for modern statistics to work, we need the opposite: Randmoness! Randomness ensures that our results can be generalized (i.e., that they are representative) and it also helps us estimate causal effects. Today, we discuss why randomness is so important for statistics. Thereafter we will recap statistical inference, that is, discuss how randomness allows us to generalize from our particular data at hand to the world at large.</p>
