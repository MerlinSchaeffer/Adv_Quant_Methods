Associations in the social world are not (necessarily) linear. The above graphic shows this quite clearly for the case of life expectancy at birth and health expenditures per capita. Luckily, OLS allows is to "linearlize" non-linear relations and to thus model even very complex non-linear associations. Today you learn two ways to do so: polynomial regression and transformations of variables before running a regression.
