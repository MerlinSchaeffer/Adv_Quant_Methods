So far we have discussed multiple OLS regression models that assume additive relationships. That education may go along with decreases in xenophobia and on top of that Danes are, on average, less xenophobic than Bulgarians. But what if the relation between xenophobia and education is different in Denmark as compared to Bulgaria? That is, what if the degree to which education predicts declining xenophobia is conditional on the country we study? Today we learn how to model such conditional relationships using "interaction terms".
