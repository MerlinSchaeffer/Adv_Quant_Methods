So far, we have discussed multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models that assume additive relationships. For example, this means that we believe that the effect of education on xenophobia is the same in Denmark and Bulgaria. However, what if this is not the case? What if the relationship between xenophobia and education is different in Denmark than in Bulgaria? In other words, what if the degree to which education predicts declining xenophobia is conditional on the country we study?

Today, we will learn how to model such *conditional* relationships using interaction terms. An interaction term is a product of two variables. In our case, the interaction term would be the product of education and country. This allows us to estimate the effect of education on xenophobia separately for Denmark and Bulgaria.
