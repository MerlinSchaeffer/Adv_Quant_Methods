Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard to estimate causal effects, but often we cannot implement them to investigate the things that really interest us. For example, we cannot study the effects of a terror attack on anti-immigrant attitudes with an RCT - it would be un-ethical to commit a terror attack and to randomly expose certain people to it. Instead of an RCT, we might get lucky and find a *Natural Experiment*.

At other times, we may be able to implement a RCT, but the respondents of our study simply don't comply to the treatment that we assign them. For example, @sherman_specific_1984 told police officers to either arrest or only warn husbands who were accused of domestic violence - but when they arrived at the scene many police officers ignored what they were told to do and did what they saw as the best strategy. Fortunately, *Instrument Variable (IV)* regression allows us to recover the causal effect.
