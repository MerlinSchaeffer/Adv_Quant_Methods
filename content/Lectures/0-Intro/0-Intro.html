<p>What will you learn in advanced stats? Why do you even need more stats than all that complex math that you learned last semester? The answer is that we will learn the fundamentals of estimating causal effects, such as does anomie increase the suicide rate, or does capitalism make us unhappy? To do so, we need to combine the lessons from your research design class (1st semester) with the lessons from your basic statistics class (last semester). This and a little extra allows us to understand the methods researchers use to answer questions we all care about.</p>
